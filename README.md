This is my Hangman Game. I made this project for passing the Google Python Program 2020.
The title is self-explanatory, it's the old fashioned game where you have to guess a random word generated from a text file.
You can either choose to guess the whole word or you can try to guess different letters. Each time you pick a wrong letter, you lose a life
You have 7 lives and if you guess the word before you don't have any lives left, you win. You can also play again after you either win/lose.
